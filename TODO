Definites:
    htmlify.p6:
        * Create and gather meta-data for subtypes for Type docs
        * Generate sub-indices for subtypes, like exceptions,
            subroutines, etc.
        * Allow to define a routine, type, or module in any documentation, which
            will allow for disambiguation pages to point to better, more
            contextful docs, and for less redundancy in the docs
            overall.
        * Emit a warning when formatting is bad. E.g., a routine that
            doesn't have a defining code block, or a page that lacks a
            proper title.
        * Figure out a way to cache and update the documentation
            registry, and when to or not to regenerate individual pages.
        * Write/generate a short description for the items of the indices
        * Create a .tar.gz to satisfy the index page's claim that
            "you can also download an offline HTML ... copy"
    Interface:
        * Add non-faded Camelia image for the index page
        * Rewrite index page as index.pod so it can be automatically generated
        * Fix redirection in app.pl to redirect to a 404 page
        * Normalize the titles of the Language docs a bit
Maybes:
    * Add "Formalities" page
    * Make links automatically be formatted super pretty, as with "language>intro"
    * A PDF version of the documentation
