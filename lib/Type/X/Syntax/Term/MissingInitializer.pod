=TITLE class X::Syntax::Term::MissingInitializer

    class X::Syntax::Term::MissingInitializer does X::Syntax { }

Syntax error when a term (a backslash variable) is declared without 
initialization assignment.

For example

    my \foo

dies with

    ===SORRY!===
    Term definition requires an initializer

Valid code would be

    my \foo = 42;

=end pod
