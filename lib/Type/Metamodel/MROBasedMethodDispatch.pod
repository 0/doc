=SUBTITLE Meta model role that locates methods potentially from superclasses

    role Metamodel::MROBasedMethodDispatch { ... }

This role implements locating methods based on the method resolution order of
related (usually "super"/"parent") types.

=head1 Methods

=head2 method find_method

    method find_method(Metamodel::MROBasedMethodDispatch:D: $obj, $name, $no_fallback)

Given a method name, returns the method object of that name which is closest
in the method resolution order (MRO). If no method can be found, it returns a
VM-specific sentinel value (typically a low-level NULL value).

If C<:no_fallback> is supplied, fallback methods are not considered.
