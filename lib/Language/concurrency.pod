=SUBTITLE Concurrency and Asynchronous Programming

In common with most modern programming languages Perl 6 is designed
to support concurrency (allowing more than one thing to happen at the
same time,) and asynchronous programming (sometime called event driven
or reactive programming - that is an even or change in some part of a
program may lead to an event or change in some other part of the program
asynchronously to the program flow. )
