=head2 X<Subroutines|declarator,sub>

To create a function, often all that's needed is to define a
subroutine using the C<sub> declarator:

    sub my-func { say "Look ma, no args!" }
    my-func;

To have the subroutine take arguments, a L<signature|Signature> goes
between the subroutine's name and its body, in parenthesis:

    =for code :allow<B L>
    sub exclaim B<($phrase)> {
        say $phrase L<~> "!!!!"
    }
    exclaim "Howdy, World";

By default, subroutines are L<lexically scoped|my>. That is
C<sub foo {...}> is the same as C<my sub foo {...}> and is only
defined in the current scope.

=begin code :allow<L>
sub escape ($str) {
    L<$_> = $str;
    # Puts a slash before non-alphanumeric characters
    L<s>:g[<-alpha-digit>] = "\\$/";
}

say escape "foo#bar?" # foo\#bar\?

{
    sub escape ($str) {
        $_ = $str;
        # Writes each non-alphanumeric character in its hexadecimal escape
        s:g|<-alpha-digit>| = "\\x[{ $/.base(16) }]";
    }

    say escape "foo#bar?" # foo\x[23]bar\x[3F]
}

# Back to original escape function
say escape "foo#bar?" # foo\#bar\?
=end code

=head2 Blocks and Lambdas

TODO

See the documentation for the L<Block> type.

=comment for, if take blocks/lambdas

=head2 Multi-dispatch

TODO
=comment multi, proto, {*}, only

=head2 Signatures

The arguments that a function accepts are described in its I<signature>.

=for code :allow<B>
sub formatB<(Str $s)> { ... }
-> B<$a, $b> { ... }

Details about the syntax and use of signatures can be found in the
L<documentation on the C<Signature> class|Signature>.
