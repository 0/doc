=TITLE class Whatever

    class Whatever { }

C<Whatever> is a class whose objects don't really do much; it gets
its semantic from other routines that accept C<Whatever>-objects as markers
to do something special. The C<*> literal in term position creates a
C<Whatever> object.

Another source of speciality is that the compiler turns
combinations of C<*> in term position and many operators into closures.
This process is called I<Whatever-currying>.

    my $c = * + 2;          # same as   -> $x { $x + 2 };
    say $c(4);              # 6

Multiple C<*> in one expression generate closures with as many arguments:

    my $c = * + *;          # same as   -> $x, $y { $x + $y }

C<*> in complex expressions also generate closures:

    my $c = 4 * * + 5;      # same as   -> $x { 4 * $x + 5 }

Calling a method on C<*> also create a closure:

    say <a b c>.map: *.uc;  # A B C

Those closure are of type L<WhateverCode>.

Not all operators and syntactic constructs curry Whatever-stars.
