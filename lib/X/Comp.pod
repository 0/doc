=TITLE role X::Comp

    role X::Comp is Exception { }

Common role for compile-time errors.

Note that since the backtrace of a compile time error generally shows
routines from the compiler, not from user-space programs, the L<Backtrace>
returned from the L<backtrace> method is not very informative. Instead
the exception carries its own C<filename>, C<line> and C<column> attributes
and public accessors.

=head1 Methods

=head2 filename

The filename in which the compilation error occurred

=head2 line

The line number in which the compilation error occurred.

=head2 column

The column number of location where the compilation error occurred.
(Rakudo does not implement that yet).
