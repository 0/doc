=TITLE class X::Bind::NativeType

    class X::Bind::NativeType does X::Comp { }

Compile-time error thrown when trying to bind to a natively typed variable.

Since native variables explicitly don't have the concept of a container at
run time. Thus it does not make sense to support both binding and assignment,
and Perl 6 supports only assignment (which makes more sense, because native
types are value types). So use assignment for natively typed variables.
