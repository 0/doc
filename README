p6doc -- an attempt to write something like 'perldoc' for Perl 6

So far only documentation for complete modules or classes is supported.

With a Rakudo 'perl6' executable in PATH, try

    ./bin/p6doc Str

to see the documentation for class Str, or

    ./bin/p6doc Str.split

to see the documentaiton for method split in class Str

Some notes:

Q: Why aren't you embedding the docs in the CORE sources?
A: Several reasons:
      1.  This documentation is intended to be universal with
          respect to a given version of the specification,
          and not necessarily tied to any specific Perl 6
          implementation.
      2.  Implementations' handling of embedded POD is still
          a bit uneven; this avoids potential runtime impacts.
      3.  A separate repo in the perl6 github account invites
          more potential contributors and editors.
