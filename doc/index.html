You may also be interested in the Perl
6 <a href="https://design.perl6.org">design documents</a>, which are in some
places more complete than this documentation, but targeted toward compiler
writers rather than users of the language. Documentation for the different but
related <a href="http://perl.org/">Perl 5</a> language can be found on
the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/">Perl 5 documentation website</a>.
